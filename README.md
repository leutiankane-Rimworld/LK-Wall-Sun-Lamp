# LK-Wall-Sun-Lamp
Adds a Cheap Wall Mounted Sun Lamp that has a 24 radius and consumes 1450 power and costs 40 steel , made from the Furniture tab. 

Adds Uber wall sun lamp locked behind LK sunlamp research found in LK sun lamp research tab 

Both sunlamps have a much larger grow zone gizmo radius (double) that a vanilla sunlamp does.

Adds Uber Wall Heater and Cooler. 

If youre using my LK Resources Mod you dont need this mod as this already exists in that mod .
